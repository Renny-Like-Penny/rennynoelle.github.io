## Welcome to RennyNoelle's Website <3

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/RennyNoelle/rennynoelle.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Background:
My name is Renny Clements and I was born and raised in Virginia Beach my whole life. I am a Senior Chemistry major with a concentration in ACS at James Madison University. My favorite things to do are bake, go to the beach, and play with puppies or really any animal.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/RennyNoelle/rennynoelle.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
